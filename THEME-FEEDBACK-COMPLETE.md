# Theme Switcher & Feedback Features - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Both the theme switcher and feedback features have been successfully implemented and are always available in the header of the application.

## Theme Switcher

### Features
- **Light Theme**: Clean, bright interface optimized for daytime use
- **Dark Theme**: Dark interface optimized for low-light conditions
- **System Theme**: Automatically follows the user's system preference

### Implementation Details

#### ThemeDropdown Component (`frontend/src/components/ThemeDropdown.jsx`)
- Provides a dropdown menu with light, dark, and system theme options
- Shows current theme with appropriate icon (Sun, Moon, Monitor)
- Always visible in the header for easy access

#### ThemeProvider Context (`frontend/src/contexts/ThemeProvider.jsx`)
- Manages theme state across the entire application
- Persists theme preference to localStorage
- Listens for system theme changes when "system" mode is selected
- Applies theme by adding/removing "dark" class from document root

#### CSS Implementation (`frontend/src/styles/globals.css`)
- Uses Tailwind CSS dark mode with class-based switching
- Defines CSS custom properties for light and dark themes
- Supports smooth transitions between themes

### Usage
The theme switcher is automatically available in the header. Users can:
1. Click the theme button (shows current theme icon)
2. Select from Light, Dark, or System options
3. Theme preference is automatically saved and restored on page reload

## Feedback Feature

### Features
- Always-available feedback button in the header
- Modal dialog for submitting feedback
- Success confirmation after submission
- Works for both authenticated and non-authenticated users

### Implementation Details

#### FeedbackSheet Component (`frontend/src/components/common/FeedbackSheet.jsx`)
- Modal-based feedback form
- Handles submission to backend API
- Shows success state after submission
- Gracefully handles authentication errors

#### Backend API (`backend/routes/feedback.js`)
- POST `/api/feedback` endpoint
- Requires authentication (JWT token)
- Validates feedback message length
- Logs feedback with user details and metadata

### Usage
The feedback option is always visible in the header. Users can:
1. Click the "Feedback" button
2. Enter their feedback in the text area
3. Submit the form
4. See confirmation of successful submission

## Integration in Header

Both features are integrated into the main header component (`frontend/src/components/Header.jsx`):

```jsx
{/* Auth Section */}
<div className="flex gap-4 justify-end items-center">
  {/* Theme Toggle - Always visible */}
  <ThemeDropdown />
  
  {/* Feedback - Always visible */}
  <FeedbackSheet />
  
  {/* Other auth-related buttons */}
  {/* ... */}
</div>
```

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with support for:
  - CSS custom properties
  - `prefers-color-scheme` media query
  - ES6+ JavaScript features
  - Local Storage

## Accessibility
- Theme switcher includes proper labels and icons
- Feedback modal is properly focused and can be closed with Escape
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG guidelines in both themes

## Testing
A test page has been created at `frontend/src/test-theme-feedback.html` to verify:
- Theme switching functionality
- Visual appearance in both light and dark modes
- Feedback modal behavior
- Local storage persistence
- System theme detection

## Technical Notes

### Theme Persistence
- Theme preference is stored in `localStorage` with key "theme"
- System theme preference is detected using `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`
- Theme changes are applied immediately without page reload

### API Integration
- Feedback submissions use JWT authentication
- Backend endpoint: `POST /api/feedback`
- Fallback behavior for unauthenticated users
- Error handling for network issues

### Performance
- Theme switching is optimized to avoid layout thrashing
- CSS custom properties enable efficient theme transitions
- Minimal re-renders when theme changes

## Troubleshooting

### Theme Not Switching
1. Check that Tailwind CSS is configured with `darkMode: ["class"]`
2. Verify CSS custom properties are defined for both light and dark themes
3. Ensure ThemeProvider is wrapping the entire application

### Feedback Not Submitting
1. Check that backend feedback route is registered in server.js
2. Verify JWT token is properly stored and sent with requests
3. Check network tab for API call status and errors

### Dark Mode Styles Missing
1. Ensure all components use appropriate dark mode classes (e.g., `dark:bg-gray-800`)
2. Check that CSS custom properties are properly defined
3. Verify Tailwind CSS is processing dark mode classes

## Future Enhancements
- Add more theme options (high contrast, custom colors)
- Implement feedback rating system
- Add feedback categories
- Store feedback in database for analytics
- Add keyboard shortcuts for theme switching
