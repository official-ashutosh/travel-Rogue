# Foreign Key Constraint Fixes

## Problem
The PostgreSQL database was failing to create tables due to foreign key constraint errors. The error message was:
```
column "userId" referenced in foreign key constraint does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The Sequelize models were missing explicit `references` configuration for foreign key relationships. While the associations were defined in `models/index.js`, the individual model definitions needed to explicitly specify the foreign key references.

## Models Fixed
The following models were updated to include proper foreign key references:

### 1. Expense.js
- **Field**: `userId` 
- **References**: `users.userId`

### 2. Plan.js  
- **Field**: `userId`
- **References**: `users.userId`

### 3. Feedback.js
- **Field**: `userId` 
- **References**: `users.userId`
- **Field**: `adminUserId`
- **References**: `users.userId`

### 4. Access.js
- **Field**: `userId`
- **References**: `users.userId`

### 5. Payment.js
- **Field**: `userId`
- **References**: `users.userId`

### 6. PlanSettings.js
- **Field**: `userId`
- **References**: `users.userId`

## Changes Made
Each `userId` field was updated from:
```javascript
userId: {
  type: DataTypes.STRING,
  allowNull: false
}
```

To:
```javascript
userId: {
  type: DataTypes.STRING,
  allowNull: false,
  references: {
    model: 'users',
    key: 'userId'
  }
}
```

## Database Reset
- Created `reset-database.js` script to drop and recreate all tables
- Successfully recreated database with proper foreign key constraints
- All models now load without errors

## Verification
- ✅ Database connection successful
- ✅ All tables created with proper foreign key constraints  
- ✅ Models load without errors
- ✅ Server can start successfully

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

The foreign key constraint errors have been completely resolved. The PostgreSQL database now properly enforces referential integrity between all related tables.
